For the paper, I suggest the following structure and talking points:

Introduction
              Paragraph 1
                             .software reliability useful (do not copy paste from past papers)
                             .Many software reliability models (cite survey or reference text)
                             .fewer software tools implementing models (a few citations to tool)
                             .however, existing tools close source or spreadsheet based and cannot easily be integrated into existing software testing work flows
              Paragraph 2
                             .review of past tool papers
                             .SMERFS, CASRE, Japanese researchers (can be taken from NSF proposals)
              Paragraph 3
                             .we present a script to automatically apply an open source software reliability tool
                             .eliminates need to work with graphical user interface to prepare report, conserving time
                             .can be configured to produce custom reports
                             .generates pdf for visually assess and reporting purposes
                             .can be used to summarize progress to technical and non-technical leadership

SFRAT
              review of UI similar to ISSAT paper/RS Magazine
Script
              script statistics/number of lines of code
              description of how to download and configure
              discussion of parameters

Illustrations
              example of application sequence that enables comparison of which model predicts best throughout the data collection process and the assessments that might have been made if this were an ongoing activity. We can do this in the context of sys1 and then adapt to NASA data.
